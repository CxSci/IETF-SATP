# Secure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP)

This is the draft charter for SATP:

# Objective

There is currently an interoperability problem in many digital asset networks, where assets in one network cannot be moved easily to another network. The problem is more acute in the case of private asset networks, where external entities have no visibility into the state of an asset in the private network.

One example is the private shipping logistics networks where the digital Bill of Lading as the value-bearing data-object is not accessible to external entities, such as trade finance networks, seeking to issue Letters of Credit based on the Bill of Lading. A second example is regulated digital representations of real-world private assets, such as property ownership certificates, and regulated government-issued digital currencies.

The goal of the Secure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP) working group will be to develop a standard protocol which operates between two peer gateways for the purpose of transferring digital assets and asset-related data between an originator in the origin asset network to a beneficiary in destination asset network.

# Problem space and architecture

To begin addressing these challenges, SATP will employ the gateway paradigm as a means for digital assets to be moved from one asset network to another through a standardized asset transfer message flow implemented between peer gateways. The same gateway paradigm will be utilized for sharing of asset-related data between two asset networks, when one or both are private networks. Thirdly, the gateway model will be used to address the case of coordinated asset swaps occurring simultaneously in two distinct asset networks. A swap here means that both users require identities on both networks, and that they agree to perform two local exchanges in a coordinated fashion.

Each gateway represents one network or system, and the SAT protocol performs a voluntary transfer of a digital asset from the origin network to a destination network, in such a way that evidence of the transfer can be obtained from both networks by a trusted third-party audit entity in the case of disputes. Both the origin and destination networks are assumed to share a common understanding of the digital asset.

There might be several gateways representing the same asset network or system. It is assumed that the same peer gateways representing the respective networks are participating in the entire asset transfer sequence from the beginning to the end.

The SAT protocol commences with the assumption that the Originator and Beneficiary, or Exchanging, entities have agreed out-of-band to proceed on the transfer or exchange of assets or asset-related data, and that both the origin and destination asset-networks can support the type of asset or data being transferred. The service providers who own and operate the respective gateways are assumed to have regulatory compliance with regards to the digital asset or assets, and have agreed to facilitate the transfer or exchange between these networks.

In the case of asset transfers, a key requirement of SATP is to ensure that the digital asset is valid in one network only at any given time. This means that SATP must ensure that the properties of atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) of the underlying networks are satisfied in an asset transfer, and that commitments or rollbacks are supported in the case of a success or failure of the asset transfer operations among the participating networks. The starting point for the discussion regarding ACID properties can be found in [draft-hardjono-sat-architecture-00](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-hardjono-sat-architecture/00/).


# Scope

The deliverables of the SATP Working Group will be as follows:

(1) SATP Architecture: The immediate scope of work for SATP will be a base architecture that utilizes the gateway paradigm that ensures a common semantic understanding to be shared among the message flows pertaining to asset transfers, the sharing of asset-related data and the coordinated asset exchanges.

(2) Asset Transfer Message Flow: The asset transfer message flow implements the transfer of a digital asset from one gateway to another, satisfying the ACID properties.

(3) Asset-Related Data Sharing Message Flow: This message flow will securely reveal views of asset-related data from an asset network to an authorized external entity using its gateway, in such a way that the correctness and authenticity of the views can be validated by the entity.

(4) Asset Exchange Message Flow: This message flow will perform a coordinated exchange of two assets in two respective asset networks, with the two corresponding gateways implementing the coordination. Work on this message flow in the SATP working group will commence only after the work on other two flows have reached their final stages.

(5) SATP Use-Cases: Various real-world use-cases will be collected and described succinctly, with the goal of providing the background to the SATP work.


SATP will define common identifiers, message flows and payloads among the above three protocol modes. A common terminology will be defined in the architecture document.

SATP will reuse existing IETF standards for various aspects of the protocol modes, including but not limited to secure channel establishment (TLS), payload formats (e.g., JSON, CBOR, ProtoBuf, etc.), digital signature and encryption (e.g., JOSE, COSE, etc.), digital certificates and tokens (e.g., PKIX, JWT, etc.), and others. SATP may also reuse existing standards from other organizations (e.g., W3C with DIDs).

Legal frameworks are outside of the scope of the SATP work.
